    This is my first single page app using React and React Router.
</p>
<p>I have shared some basic knowledge about the various cloud offerings available and the projects I have engaged in as well as published

    I have had had the opportunity to learn about various cloud platforms, their offerings and how to utilize them for my devops based career path. 
    This is one of the various options I am using. The main goal is to be able to host this app on AWS via the Amplify Console. 
    I will delve into other devops based routines afterwards. From Containerisation and Orchestration to Configuration Management.
